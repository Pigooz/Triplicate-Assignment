# Triplicate-Assignment
1 similarity + 1 difference you noticed across Unity / Unreal / Godot while importing Kenney assets + building the level.

I think 1 similarity that I noticed while using all these different engines is that they all kind of have the same interface. During all my times with the engines it was very easy to navigate where I was going with basically the content being in the bottom with the editing of said objects and 3d models being on the right side of the screen and they also had the same keys to move, rotate, and scale. 1 difference I would say is that Unity and Unreal kind of do the same thing where you can create prefabs just by combining them into either a prefab or a blueprint. In godot you have to create a scene for that which is kind of weird because its also how you create a level as well.

Instancing comparison (1–2 sentences): Prefabs vs Blueprint Actors vs PackedScenes — what felt the same, what felt different.

I think what felt the same between these 3 is that it was relatively easy to make a "prefab" in all 3 engines if you knew how to either just drag the combined object into your content in unity, make a blueprint in unreal, or make a new scene in godot. Definetly the easiest was a prefab in unity as it was just a click and drop. What felt different was the way you made the "prefab" in each as they all have a different way of getting to that goal.



Your pick (1 sentence): If you had to rebuild the same level again, which engine would you choose and why.

I would probably use Unity for the level as it seems to be a good fit with the assets and is easy to navigate and use. The engine also runs smoothly compared to unreal which takes a lot of power.
